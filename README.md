# PySorting
A repository of common sorting algorithms done in Python.  It's useful to actually implement the algoritms yourself as a refresher... who really remembers the Big-O complexity off the top of their head?

# Usage

`python sorting.py`

```
python sorting.py

[14, 33, 27, 10, 35, 19, 42, 44]
    bubble_sort    sorted in 32  iterations and took: 0:00:00.000555
    insertion_sort sorted in 14  iterations and took: 0:00:00.000014
    selection_sort sorted in 35  iterations and took: 0:00:00.000019
